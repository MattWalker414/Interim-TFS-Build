# Interim-TFS-Build
Interim Adept Cloud Build through Azure DevOps Server
This is used to offset the issue of initial Get from GitHub being placed directly in the build sources folder and not a specified sub folder.
The Adept Web Server and Client along with any other future repos will be cloned via script so that the needed folder structure can be achieved.
